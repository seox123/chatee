## Team name: Chatee

Developers : Chen Shun & Law Sean Meng

Proposed Orbital level of achievement: Apollo

## Motivation

When you chat about different topics all the time in a large group and you want to refer back to a specific topic that has been buried under other conversation topics, it is often **difficult and time-consuming** to navigate. When you try to search for a topic using current features, you have to try to recall what words were used to navigate back, so why not group conversation chunks under topics that can be easily referred to?

Many people also use chat groups to plan events, but there is a **lack of an integrated feature** that allows for planning and tracking of events within the messaging app.

Common messaging apps are used for both work and private life and this limits the user interface to be generally **unexciting**. With a messaging app more dedicated towards personal usage, we can appeal to friend groups looking for a more **attractive** user interface.


## Aim

We hope to make a more engaging messaging platform to socialise with your friends or loved ones.

## User Stories

1.	I want to be able to categorise conversations and look up portions related to a specific topic easily. 

2.	I want to be able to schedule and track events as I plan them with my friends, and have a clear overview of all my events both within specific group chats and across all of them.

3.	I want a novel and refreshing messaging environment with which to connect with my friends and loved ones. 

## Feature list

Our core features include: 
  1. Tagging system - to catergorise conversation for easy lookup
  2. Event sheduling function - to allow users to track important dates in relevant group chats
  3. A gamified point system - to incentivise users to spend time bonding in group chats.
  4. A personalised private space for each group chat - to create an engaging chatting environment. Users can use points to purchase virtual items to decorate their common space.
